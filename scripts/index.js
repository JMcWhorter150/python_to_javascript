// Variables! (Storing single pieces of information)
// turkey_legs_consumed = 3
var turkeyLegsConsumed = 3;
// 1. prefix your variables the first time you use them
// 2. Use camelCase!
// 3. Terminate each line with ';'
let turkeysCooked = 2;
// 'var' was the original way to declare variables.
// 'let' is better because
// 1. It gives you more control. (You can limit its use to a specific if/else or a specific loop)
// 2. 

// 'const' is like 'let' (in that it is local), but:
// - you must assign it when you declare it.
// - You can never reassign it.

const numberOfTurkeysICanEat = 1;

// How to use these keywords:
// 1. Create your variables using 'const'
// 2. If you find out that you need to reassign it, change it to 'let'.
